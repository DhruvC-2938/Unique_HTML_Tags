<keygen> Tag — Explanation Document
1. What the <keygen> tag does

The <keygen> tag generates a public–private key pair inside the user’s browser when a form is submitted.

The private key is stored securely in the browser.

The public key is sent to the server as part of the form submission.

It was typically used inside HTML <form> elements.

2. Why the <keygen> tag exists

The <keygen> tag was introduced to simplify client-side cryptographic key generation without requiring JavaScript or external libraries.

Its main goals were:

To make secure authentication easier

To enable certificate-based login systems

To offload cryptographic complexity to the browser

At the time, this was considered a secure and user-friendly approach.

3. Real-world use cases / examples
a) Certificate-based authentication

Used in systems where users authenticate using digital certificates instead of passwords, such as:

Corporate intranets

Secure government portals

Banking authentication systems

b) SSL client certificates

Servers could issue a client certificate based on the public key generated by <keygen>, enabling:

Mutual TLS authentication

Strong identity verification

c) Secure device registration

Devices or users could register securely without manually generating keys.

Important Note (Very Exam-Relevant / Interview-Relevant)

⚠️ The <keygen> tag is now OBSOLETE

Removed from the HTML standard

Not supported in modern browsers

Replaced by:

Web Cryptography API (window.crypto.subtle)

JavaScript-based key generation

Modern authentication protocols (OAuth, WebAuthn)
